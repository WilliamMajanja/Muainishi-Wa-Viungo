## 🧬 About The Project

The field of transfusion and transplant medicine is a data-rich environment, yet scientists often grapple with disconnected tools and complex datasets. This fragmentation slows down research, delays critical insights, and hinders the development of personalized treatments.

**Muainishi Wa Viungo** solves this by offering a single, intuitive, and powerful web application that seamlessly integrates various bioinformatic analyses. From initial sample classification to tracking post-transplant mutations, our platform is the all-in-one solution for advanced analysis.

## ✨ Key Features

Our platform offers a comprehensive suite of analysis modules:

*   **📊 Dashboard:** A central hub for a high-level overview of all analyses and system status, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
*   **🔬 Cell Type Classification:** Leverage machine learning to classify tissue samples and cell types from raw genetic expression data with high accuracy.
*   **🎨 Tissue Segmentation:** Automatically identify and segment distinct tissue structures from high-resolution histology slides, saving countless hours of manual work.
*   **🔗 Multi-Omics Integration:** Unify genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and more, to uncover the complex biological narratives hidden within integrated datasets.
*   **💊 Pharmacogenomics Analysis:** Predict patient responses to immunosuppressants and other critical drugs by analyzing key genetic markers.
*   **📈 Somatic Mutation Tracking:** Monitor the clonal evolution of somatic mutations over time-series data, crucial for understanding graft-versus-host disease and post-transplant complications.
*   **🌳 Evolutionary Insights:** Reconstruct phylogenetic trees from gene sequences to visualize macro-evolutionary relationships and trace allele origins.
*   **🧠 Powered by Google Gemini:** At our core, we utilize the power of Google's Gemini API for intelligent data interpretation, visualization generation, and uncovering novel insights that would be missed by traditional methods.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

We use a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack to deliver a seamless user experience.

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
*   **AI & Backend:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)
*   **Database:** [Neon Serverless Postgres](https://neon.tech/)
*   **Deployment:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
